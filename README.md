# sokoban
# {EPITECH} | First year | Unix System programming project

## Description
The goal of the Sokoban project is to recode the Sokoban game, obviously in a version compatible with a Linux terminal. 
To achieve this, the player has the ability to move boxes (represented by 'X') by pushing them with their character (represented by 'P') to fill all the spaces (represented by 'O').

## Get started

### Compile the programm

Navigate to the root of the repository from your Terminal and run `make` to build the static library, 
now you have created a binary that can compile the program. You can also use `make clean` to delete the `.o` files created
by the `make` command.

### Use the sokoban
In order to use the binary `my_ls`, you need to execute : `./my_ls [map]`
